        <h3>my different personalities</h3>
        <h4>THE DEVELOPER</h4>
        <p>
          • handles incoming requests like a pro, and never misses a deadline
          even if it was yesterday. <br />
          • always understands clients’ business needs as she is capable of
          reading minds. <br />• delivers only the best as it comes straight
          from her heart. THE CREATIVE MIND
        </p>
        <h4>THE CREATIVE MIND</h4>
        <p>
          • is the queen of unconventional solutions such as picking oranges
          from an apple tree and making the best lemonade you ever tasted.
          <br />
          • wriggles her way out of the most impossible situation with
          resourcefulness and ingenuity – inspired by the one and only MacGyver.
          <br />• builds ideas on the combination of constraints and
          free-thinking like an artist and a scientist in tandem.

        <h4>THE EXPLORER</h4>
        <p>
          • thrives in the space of the unknown and conquers the uncharted with
          the help of her sixth sense. <br />
          • she is not afraid to ask for help in case her compass is not
          working.
          <br />• Google is her best friend! Together they could conquer the
          whole wide world.

        <h3>a few projects i was working on in the past</h3>
        <h4>skanzen.hu</h4>
        <p>
          This was my first and at the same time independently executed project.
          <br />
          Had to create 3 frontend layouts{" "}
          <a href="https://skanzen.hu/" arget="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
            skanzen.hu
          </a>
          ,{" "}
          <a href="https://hotel.skanzen.hu/" arget="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
            hotel.skanzen.hu
          </a>{" "}
          and{" "}
          <a href="https://szennai.skanzen.hu/" arget="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
            szennai.skanzen.hu
          </a>
          .
        </p>
        <h4>streamfit.hu</h4>
        <p>
          I inherited this project from a colleague and had to finish and expand
          it's functionality.
          <br />
          <a href="https://streamfit.hu/" arget="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
            streamfit.hu
          </a>{" "}
        </p>
        <h4>aquaticum.hu</h4>
        <p>
          This was a real teamwork project due to its complexity. I worked on it
          with two colleagues closely.
          <br />
          <a href="https://www.aquaticum.hu/en" arget="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
            aquaticum.hu
          </a>{" "}
        </p>
        <h4>supershop.hu</h4>
        <p>
          I joined the project and expanded its functionality on a weekly basis.
          <br />
          <a href="https://supershop.hu/" arget="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
            supershop.hu
          </a>{" "}
        </p>
        <h4>gyermekelsosegely.hu</h4>
        <p>
          It is mainly a Flutter-based application, but it also includes a
          public website. I created the frontend on my own.
          <br />
          <i>
            This application is designed for parents, helping them learn first
            aid for their children. Additionally, there is a professional
            version for doctors and ambulance staff, which includes medication
            search and dosage information. However, for logical reasons, this
            version is not publicly accessible.
          </i>
